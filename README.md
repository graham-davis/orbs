#Orbs FM Sequencer
####Graham Davis - Music 256a

Orbs is an FM synthesis sequencer. The 8 sequencer voices are controlled by their own "orb". 
Double clicking on an orb or hitting the corresponding keyboard number key engages the voice. Clicking
the space bar reverses which orbs are engaged and which are silenced. Dragging
an orb up and down changes the pitch of its voice. The rate and gain of the sequencer are controlled 
using the corresponding sliders. Similarly, the frequency and index of the modulating oscillator of the 
FM tones are controlled by sliders. 

Possible future improvements include controlling the volume and FM parameters of each voice indivually,
preset arpeggiated sequences, and reversing direction of the sequencer.
